                "Hi, I'm Hadassaâ€”an architect and urban planner transitioning into tech. My passion for design, aesthetics, and process optimization led me to full-stack development, where I combine creativity with functionality.
                I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), building sleek interfaces and seamless user experiences. I love crafting well-thought-out systems, automating workflows, and ensuring every detail serves a purpose.

                Beyond tech, I'm deeply into art, fashion, and organization. I draw inspiration from the retro-futuristic aesthetics of the 80s, 90s, and 2000s, always exploring new ways to blend visuals with technology.

                If you believe that design and code can transform experiences, let's connect!"
